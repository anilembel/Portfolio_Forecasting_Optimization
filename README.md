## Data Analysis on Stock Data

In this project, data analysis was performed on Coca-Cola, Monster, Pepsi and Carlsberg stocks. Data analysis aims to observe the relationships between the returns and risks of stocks. For this purpose, it is aimed to find high return and low risk portfolios.

## Using the Model

As a result of the analysis, a model was created in order to find the portfolios with the highest return and the lowest risk. This model was used to analyze the data and exported the results as a CSV file. These files are then used in a Tableau dashboard.

## Creating Dashboards


Based on the analysis of the data and the model results, a Tableau dashboard was prepared. This dashboard visualizes the relationships between returns and risks of stocks. The Dashboard is useful for understanding stocks' past performance and future potential. Dashboard includes several different charts and tables and provides an easy interface for understanding and interpreting data.
