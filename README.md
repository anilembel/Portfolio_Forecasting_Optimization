This repository contains the following directories:

1. Dashboard
This directory contains a Tableau document and a PNG image of the dashboard created for this project.

2. Notebooks
This directory contains two Jupyter Notebooks:

## Data Analysis on Stock Data

In this project I scraped data for Coca-Cola, Monster, Pepsi and Carlsberg stocks data thanks to the pyfinance library. Data analysis has been made on these companies with the data of the last 7 years. Data analysis aims to observe the relationships between returns and risks of stocks. For this purpose, it is aimed to find high-yielding and low-risk portfolios.

## Using the Model

As a result of the analysis, We choose the 3 most efficient portfolios among 500 portfolios randomly generated without using any statistical models.
 
<ul>
  <li>Highest Return Portfolio</li>
  <li>Least Risk Portfolio</li>
  <li>The best sharp ratio ship portfolio</li>
</ul>


This model was used to analyze the data and exported the results as a CSV file. These files are then used in a Tableau dashboard.

## Creating Dashboards


Based on the analysis of the data and the model results, a Tableau dashboard was prepared with 12-page Sheets, Through Dashboard, we can see the change in Adj Close prices over time, the lows, highs, and volumes over time. Thanks to the dynamic time filter, you can review the data and your portfolio temporally, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly at any time. 

This dashboard visualizes the relationships between returns and risks of stocks. The Dashboard is useful for understanding stocks' past performance and future potential. Dashboard includes several different charts and tables and provides an easy interface for understanding and interpreting data. 

A very practical dashboard to use the random portfolios created and tight follow-up and analysis of your portfolio.
